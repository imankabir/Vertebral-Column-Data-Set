# Vertebral-Column-Data-Set
KNN binary classification with various distance metrics

- Preprocessed and conducted exploratory data analysis

- Genereated learning curve to determine the optimal training set size for multiple k-values (neighbors) using Euclidean distance

- Exercised using other distance metrics such as: Minkowski, Manhattan, Chebyshev, and Mahalanobis

- Variant of KNN: Used majority polling instead of weighted decision to perform classification
